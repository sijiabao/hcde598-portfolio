    <h1>Jessica's HCDE 598 Portfolio</h1>

    <p>I am Jessica Bao, a first-year MS HCDE student with a BS in HCDE.</p>
    <p>I would like to be a UX Researcher in the future, but it is always good to challenge myself and learn something out of my comfort zone.</p> 
    <p>I've tried HTML/CSS on my own before and I am excited to learn more advanced programming languages!</p> 
    <p>I enjoy green, coffee, and the sea in my spare time.</p>
