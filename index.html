HCDE 598 Portfolio

I am Jessica Bao, a first-year MS HCDE student with a BS in HCDE. 
I would like to be a UX Researcher in the future, but it is always good to challenge myself and learn something out of my comfort zone. 
I've tried HTML/CSS on my own before and I am excited to learn more advanced programming languages! 
I enjoy green, coffee, and the sea in my spare time.
